Delta Calculator for Quadratic Functions
This is a simple Python script that calculates the delta value for quadratic functions of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, and outputs the result.

Usage
To use the script, simply run it in a Python environment. You will be prompted to input the values of a, b, and c for your quadratic function. The script will then calculate the delta value and output the result.

Delta Calculation
The delta value is calculated using the formula delta = b^2 - 4ac. If delta is negative, the script will output a message indicating that there are no real solutions. If delta is zero, the script will output the single solution for x. If delta is positive, the script will output both solutions for x.

Dependencies
The script requires the fsqrt function to calculate the square root of a number. This function is defined within the script.
